## **Publications**
<br>

1. [The Effect of Social Media on Corporate Innovation: Evidence from Seeking Alpha Coverage](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4798681), ***Management Science***, *Forthcoming*
    - With Henry Leung, Buhui Qiu and Zhou Zhou
    - **Short Summary:** Social media coverage promotes corporate innovation by disseminating innovation-related information about the covered firm to external investors, thereby alleviating the firm's financial constraints.

## **Working Papers**

1. [Firm-Level Labor-Shortage Exposure](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4410126)
    - With Jarrad Harford and Buhui Qiu
    - **Selected Presentations:** AFA 2025 Poster (scheduled), FIRS 2024, NFA 2024*, CICF 2024, Australasian Finance and Banking Conference (AFBC) 2023, Sydney Banking and Financial Stability Conference (SBFC) 2023, Banking and Finance Forum at Macquarie University*
    - **Short Summary:** We use a large language model to develop a novel measure of labor-shortage exposure at the firm level. Firms with labor-shortage exposures experience lower earnings call CARs, future stock returns and operating performance. Firms respond to labor shortages by substituting labor with capital and R&D investments, and by producing more production-process patents.

<br>

2. [Greenwashing: Measurement and Implications](https://iamqiyanghe.github.io)
    - With Ben Marshall, Hung Nguyen, Nhut Nguyen, Buhui Qiu and Nuttawat Visaltanachoti
    - **Selected Presentations:** AEA 2025 Poster (scheduled), SFS Cavalcade Asia-Pacific 2024 (scheduled), UNPRI Academic Network Conference 2024 (scheduled), GRASFI 2024, FMA Asia 2024
    - **Short Summary:** We match corporate green talk identified by a large language model with actual environmental incidents from RepRisk to construct a comprehensive measure of firm-level greenwashing intensity. We find that managers engage in greenwashing to increase their job security and compensation, at the expense of shareholders and other stakeholders.
