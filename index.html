<li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4798681" style="color: RoyalBlue; font-weight: bold;">The Effect of Social Media on Corporate Innovation: Evidence from Seeking Alpha Coverage</a>, <em><strong>Management Science</strong></em>, <em>Forthcoming</em><ul>
<li>With Henry Leung, Buhui Qiu and Zhou Zhou</li>
<li><span style="color: Chocolate; font-weight: bold;">Short Summary:</span> Social media coverage promotes corporate innovation by disseminating innovation-related information about the covered firm to external investors, thereby alleviating the firm&#39;s financial constraints.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4798681" style="color: RoyalBlue; font-weight: bold;">Environmental Enforcement Actions and Corporate Green Innovation</a>, <em><strong>Journal of Corporate Finance</strong></em>, 2025<ul>
<li>With Buhui Qiu</li>
<li><span style="color: Chocolate; font-weight: bold;">Short Summary:</span> EPA enforcement actions cause reputational damage to the enforced firms, prompting them to develop more green patents. The positive effect is stronger when the reputational damage is more severe. Overall, the enforced firms use green patents as a costly but credible signal to the market for reputation remediation.</li>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4410126" style="color: RoyalBlue; font-weight: bold;">Firm-Level Labor-Shortage Exposure</a><ul>
<li>With Jarrad Harford and Buhui Qiu</li>
<li><span style="color: Chocolate; font-weight: bold;">Selected Presentations:</span> AFA 2025 Poster (scheduled), FIRS 2024, NFA 2024^, CICF 2024, Australasian Finance and Banking Conference (AFBC) 2023, Sydney Banking and Financial Stability Conference (SBFC) 2023, Banking and Finance Forum at Macquarie University^</li>
<li><span style="color: Chocolate; font-weight: bold;">Short Summary:</span> We use a large language model to develop a novel measure of labor-shortage exposure at the firm level. Firms with labor-shortage exposures experience lower earnings call CARs, future stock returns and operating performance. Firms respond to labor shortages by substituting labor with capital and R&amp;D investments, and by producing more production-process patents.</li>

<li><span style="color: Chocolate; font-weight: bold;">Short Summary:</span> We match corporate green talk identified by a large language model with actual environmental incidents from RepRisk to construct a comprehensive measure of firm-level greenwashing intensity. We find that managers engage in greenwashing to increase their job security and compensation, at the expense of shareholders and other stakeholders.</li>
